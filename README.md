# Blockchain

A "naive blockchain" implementation in Elixir inspired by [this JS implementation](https://github.com/lhartikk/naivechain)

**This is a work in progress**

# TODO

- [ ] query all blocks when connecting to a peer
- [ ] allow remote host (only localhost for now)
- [ ] "pretty" list peers
- [ ] more commands in the Blockchain module
- [ ] http interface using phoenix (umbrella project)
